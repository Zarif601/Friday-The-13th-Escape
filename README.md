# Friday-The-13th-Escape

This project is a game called "Friday The 13th: Escape." The game is based in a camping ground, where the player starts off from a cabin and has to navigate his way out of the camping grounds to escape the antagonist, Jason. If the player encounters Jason, the game ends and the player loses. However, if the player can get to the exit before encountering Jason, he wins the game.

There are total 9 locations in the game where the player can move to. Among them, there are 2 locations where Jason can be encountered. Those two locations are hard-coded to be 'Park walls' and 'Western lake.' Among the 9 locations, there is only 1 'Exit' where the player has to get to, to win the game.

To play the game, the player will be asked to put inputs. To move to different locations in the game, the player has to input 'go' followed by 'up/down/left/right' depending on which direction the player wants to move towards and then press enter. So for example, if the used wants to move to the location on the right, the input would be: 'go right'
